  <h1>essential peripherals</h1>
  <h2>chapter goals</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Explain how to support multipurpose connectors</li>
    <li>Identify and install standard peripherals (that aren’t display devices) on a PC</li>
    <li>Identify and install standard storage devices (that aren’t SSDs or HDDs) and their media</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>notes</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Each standard defines more than just the speed. Because they were incorporated into the newer standard, many Low-Speed and Full-Speed USB devices <br> are also USB 2.0 devices.</li>
    <li>In general, your connection will operate at the speed of the slowest device involved. If you have a USB 2.0 device connected to a USB 3.x port on your<br> PC, it will operate at USB 2.0 speeds.</li>
    <li>There are exceptions to the “install the driver first” rule. USB thumb drives, for example, don’t need extra drivers at all. Just plug them in and every<br> modern OS will pick them up. (Technically speaking, though, that means the drivers came preinstalled
      with the operating system!)</li>
    <li>Like <div class="tooltip">USB <span class="tooltiptext"> <img src="../pictures/usb-jack.jpg" alt="usb hub" width = "300px" height="300px">universal serial bus</span> </div> ports (or any other ports, for that matter), you can always add more FireWire ports using a PCI or PCIe expansion card. Standard installation procedures apply.</li>
    <li>A “known good” device is simply a device that you know is in good working order. All techs count heavily on the use of known good devices to check other devices. For example, if you think a PC has a bad keyboard, borrow one from the PC next door and
      see if that keyboard works on the broken machine.</li>
    <li>You might also need to configure your controller from within the game you want to play. Most games are set to use keyboard and mouse controls by default. You’ll need to play around with the settings to enable your game controller. Once you’ve set
      up your controller, you should be ready to take to the skies, or the streets, or wherever else you go to game.</li>
    <li>Not all digitizers are designed for digital art. Some are used for handwriting, technical drawings, writing complex characters, or even as a replacement pointing device.</li>
    <li>In addition to drivers, most digitizers require specific software to use their advanced functions. With digital art digitizers, for example, you’ll need a graphic arts program like Adobe Illustrator or Autodesk SketchBook, which know how to use several
      brands and varieties of pen tablets.</li>
    <li>Most folks use their smartphones today for casual pictures and video, but the CompTIA A+ 901 objectives assume separate devices.</li>
    <li>While digital cameras and digital camcorders can be considered distinct products, their features have become nearly identical. Both take pictures. Both take videos. In fact, a lot of high-end digital cameras take better video than digital camcorders.
      Because of this feature and function overlap, I’m presenting them here together. Storage Media—Digital Film Digital cameras and camcorders save the pictures and videos they take onto some type of removable storage media. Think of it as digital film.
      Probably the most common removable storage media used in modern digital cameras (and probably your best choice) is the Secure Digital (SD) card (see Figure 11-30). For details about removable storage media, see the discussion in the “Storage Devices”
      section, later in this chapter.</li>
    <li>Many digital camcorders include built-in hard drives for storing large amounts of high-definition (HD) video. This removes the need to constantly switch out memory cards.</li>
    <li>Every modern motherboard comes with sound-processing capabilities built in. By default, techs refer to built-in sound as either built-in sound or as a sound card, even when there’s no expansion card for sound. I’ll do the same in this chapter.</li>
    <li>WAV and MP3 are only two among a large number of file formats for sound. Not all sound players can play all of these formats; however, many sound formats are nothing more than some type of compressed WAV file, so with the right codec loaded, you can
      play most sound formats.</li>
    <li><div class="tooltip"> MIDI <span class="tooltiptext"> musical instrument digital interface </span> </div> files typically have the file extension .MID in Windows. This harkens back to the ancient three-character file extension limitation of Microsoft’s first OS, DOS.</li>
    <li>As they do with new microprocessor models, Intel gave the HDA standard a codename as well. Look for motherboards offering the Azalia sound option. That’s Intel High Definition Audio.</li>
    <li>Only a few 5.1 PC speaker sets come with S/PDIF. In most cases, you’ll have to use the regular audio outputs on the sound card. You’ll find the connector more common on 6.1 and 7.1 sets.</li>
    <li>You can also buy microphones that connect via USB instead of the microphone port. Microphones can also be used with speech-to-text programs that listen to what you say and then type it out on the screen. These programs can be finicky to use, but they’re
      still fun to play around with. If you do use speech-to-text programs, look for a headset that has a built-in microphone (see Figure 11-47). The quality will be lower, but it will keep your hands free. (These headsets are also great for voice chatting
      while playing games on a PC or game console.)</li>
    <li>Some video capture devices are external, while others are internal PCI or PCIe cards. If you have an internal video capture card, install it into your PC as you would any other expansion card.</li>
    <li>TV tuners often include components for video capture, so you can get both devices on one card or expansion device.</li>

  <h1>exam tips</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>The USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) does not officially use “Low-Speed” and “Full-Speed” to describe 1.5-Mbps and 12-Mbps devices, calling both of them simply <br>“USB 1.1.” On the CompTIA A+ certification exams, though, you’ll see the marketplace-standard
      nomenclature used here. For the 220-901 exam, focus on USB 1.1, 2.0, and 3.0.</li>
    <li>On USB 1.1 and 2.0 cables, the A and B ports and connectors use four pins, while the rest use five pins. USB 3.0/3.1 A and B ports and connectors use nine pins.<br> A larger, 11-pin USB 3.0/3.1 B connector that can supply extra power to a device also
      exists.
    </li>
    <li>USB Type-C connectors don’t show up in the exam objectives as of this writing, but the “universal” connector for USB is rolling out quickly now. The running joke <br>about USB is that every connector has three sides: Up position; Down position; and
      the third time you try to plug it in and it works, the Superposition. USB Type-C just plugs in either way.</li>
    <li>Know the characteristics and purposes of USB, FireWire, and Thunderbolt connection interfaces for the exams.</li>
